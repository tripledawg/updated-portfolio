# Updated Portfolio

## Description   

I have updated my portfolio to feature my top three work samples so far. The first is the server-side API project called Dinner and a Movie.  For this project I designed the UI and programmed the API call that converted zipcodes to latitude and longitude coordinates.  The other two works samples are homework assignments that involve third party and server-side APIs.
